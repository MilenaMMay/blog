# Green IT companies in Germany

[MOIA](https://www.moia.io/en) has been the first company I worked for with a green mission. Before, I always chose an employer that would do nothing harmful so that at least I don't contribute to something bad.
Having experienced that it is possible to work for a green mission AND earn money, I included this criteria in my next job search and will continue to work for a green mission in my next job at [Resourcify](https://www.resourcify.de/).

I want to share with you my list of IT companies in Germany with a green or sustainability mission so that you as well can contribute to something good while earning money.

Inspired by [https://github.com/danielbayerlein/remote-jobs-germany](https://github.com/danielbayerlein/remote-jobs-germany) and [https://github.com/remoteintech/remote-jobs](https://github.com/remoteintech/remote-jobs)

I used the [list in this blog post](https://www.speedinvest.com/blog/europes-leadership-in-climate-tech), [https://forpurposejobs.com/](https://forpurposejobs.com/) and [https://www.greentech.earth/](https://www.greentech.earth/) as sources as well as the company's job ads. Feel free to [create a Pull Request](https://github.com/MilenaMMay/blog) to add more companies and correct assumptions if you have more insights.
